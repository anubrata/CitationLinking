This paper describes an algorithm which automatically discovers word senses from free text and maps them to the appropriate entries of existing dictionaries or taxonomies. Automatic word sense discovery has applications of many kinds. It can greatly facilitate a lexicographer's work and can be used to automatically construct corpus-based taxonomies or to tune existing ones. The same corpus evidence which supports a clustering of an ambiguous word into distinct senses can be used to decide which sense is referred to in a given context (Schiitze, 1998). This paper is organised as follows. In section 2, we present the graph model from which we discover word senses. Section 3 describes the way we divide graphs surrounding ambiguous words into different areas corresponding to different senses, using Markov clustering (van Dongen, 2000). The quality of the Markov clustering depends strongly on several parameters such as a granularity factor and the size of the local graph. In section 4, we outline a word sense discovery algorithm which bypasses the problem of parameter tuning. We conducted a pilot experiment to examine the performance of our algorithm on a set of words with varying degree of ambiguity. Section 5 describes the experiment and presents a sample of the results. Finally, section 6 sketches applications of the algorithm and discusses future work.
