Recent work has motivated the need for systemsthat support Information Synthesis tasks, in whicha user seeks a global understanding of a topic orstory (Amigo et al., 2004). In contrast to the classical question answering setting (e.g. TREC-style Q&A (Voorhees and Tice, 2000)), in which the userpresents a single question and the system returns acorresponding answer (or a set of likely answers), inthis case the user has a more complex informationneed. Similarly, when reading about a complex newsstory, such as an emergency situation, users mightseek answers to a set of questions in order to understand it better. For example, Figure 1 showsthe interface to our Web-based news summarizationsystem, which a user has queried for informationabout Hurricane Isabel. Understanding such storiesis challenging for a number of reasons. In particular,complex stories contain many sub-events (e.g. thedevastation of the hurricane, the relief effort, etc.) Inaddition, while some facts surrounding the situationdo not change (such as Which area did the hurricane first hit?), others may change with time (Howmany people have been left homeless?). Therefore, we are working towards developing a systemfor question answering from clusters of complex stories published over time. As can be seen at the bottom of Figure 1, we plan to add a component to ourcurrent system that allows users to ask questions asthey read a story. They may then choose to receiveeither a precise answer or a question-focused summary. Currently, we address the question-focused sentence retrieval task. While passage retrieval (PR) isclearly not a new problem (e.g. (Robertson et al.,1992; Salton et al., 1993)), it remains important andyet often overlooked. As noted by (Gaizauskas et al.,2004), while PR is the crucial first step for questionanswering, Q&A research has typically not empha915 Hurricane Isabel's outer bands moving onshoreproduced on 09/18, 6:18 AM 2% SummaryThe North Carolina coast braced for a weakened but still potent Hurricane Isabel while already rain-soaked areas as faraway as Pennsylvania prepared for possibly ruinous flooding. (2:3) A hurricane warning was in effect from CapeFear in southern North Carolina to the VirginiaMaryland line, and tropical storm warnings extended from South Carolinato New Jersey. (2:14) While the outer edge of the hurricane approached the North Carolina coast Wednesday, the center of the storm was still400 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C., late Wednesday morning.

Around 200,000 people in coastal areas of North Carolina and Virginia were ordered to evacuate or risk getting trappedby flooding from storm surges up to 11 feet. (5:8) The storm was expected to hit with its full fury today, slamming intothe North Carolina coast with 105mph winds and 45-foot wave crests, before moving through Virginia and bashing thecapital with gusts of about 60 mph.

The specific problem we consider differsfrom the classic task of PR for a Q&A system ininteresting ways, due to the time-sensitive nature ofthe stories in our corpus. For example, one challengeis that the answer to a users question may be updated and reworded over time by journalists in orderto keep a running story fresh, or because the factsthemselves change. Therefore, there is often morethan one correct answer to a question.We aim to develop a method for sentence retrieval that goes beyond finding sentences that aresimilar to a single query. To this end, we propose to use a stochastic, graph-based method. Recently, graph-based methods have proved useful fora number of NLP and IR tasks such as documentre-ranking in ad hoc IR (Kurland and Lee, 2005)and analyzing sentiments in text (Pang and Lee,2004). In (Erkan and Radev, 2004), we introducedthe LexRank method and successfully applied it togeneric, multi-document summarization. Presently,we introduce topic-sensitive LexRank in creating asentence retrieval system. We evaluate its performance against a competitive baseline, which considers the similarity between each sentence and thequestion (using IDF-weighed word overlap). Wedemonstrate that LexRank significantly improvesquestion-focused sentence selection over the baseline.
