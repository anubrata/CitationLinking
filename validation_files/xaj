IBM models and the hidden Markov model (HMM) for word alignment are the most influential statistical word alignment models (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2003). There are three kinds of important information for word alignment models: lexicality, locality and fertility. IBM Model 1 uses only lexical information; IBM Model 2 and the hidden Markov model take advantage of both lexical and locality information; IBM Models 4 and 5 use all three kinds of information, and they remain the state of the art despite the fact that they were developed almost two decades ago. Recent experiments on large datasets have shown that the performance of the hidden Markov model is very close to IBM Model 4. Nevertheless, we believe that IBM Model 4 is essentially a better model because it exploits the fertility of words in the tar get language. However, IBM Model 4 is so complex that most researches use the GIZA++ software package (Och and Ney, 2003), and IBM Model 4 itself is treated as a black box. The complexity in IBM Model 4 makes it hard to understand and to improve. Our goal is to build a model that includes lexicality, locality, and fertility; and, at the same time, to make it easy to understand. We also want it to be accurate and computationally efficient. There have been many years of research on word alignment. Our work is different from others in essential ways. Most other researchers take either the HMM alignments (Liang et al., 2006) or IBM Model 4 alignments (Cherry and Lin, 2003) as input and perform post-processing, whereas our model is a potential replacement for the HMM and IBM Model 4. Directly modeling fertility makes our model fundamentally different from others. Most models have limited ability to model fertility. Liang et al. (2006) learn the alignment in both translation directions jointly, essentially pushing the fertility towards 1. ITG models (Wu, 1997) assume the fertility to be either zero or one. It can model phrases, but the phrase has to be contiguous. There have been works that try to simulate fertility using the hidden Markov model (Toutanova et al., 2002; Deng and Byrne, 2005), but we prefer to model fertility directly. Our model is a coherent generative model that combines the HMM and IBM Model 4. It is easier to understand than IBM Model 4 (see Section 3). Our model also removes several undesired properties in IBM Model 4.

Qc 2010 Association for Computational Linguistics estimation. Our distortion parameters are similar to IBM Model 2 and the HMM, while IBM Model 4 uses inverse distortion (Brown et al., 1993). Our model assumes that fertility follows a Poisson distribution, while IBM Model 4 assumes a multinomial distribution, and has to learn a much larger number of parameters, which makes it slower and less reliable. Our model is much faster than IBM Model 4. In fact, we will show that it is also faster than the HMM, and has lower alignment error rate than the HMM. Parameter estimation for word alignment models that model fertility is more difficult than for models without fertility. Brown et al. (1993) and Och and Ney (2003) first compute the Viterbi alignments for simpler models, then consider only some neighbors of the Viterbi alignments for modeling fertility. If the optimal alignment is not in those neighbors, this method will not be able find the opti total of I + 1 empty words for the HMM model1. Moore (2004) also suggested adding multiple empty words to the target sentence for IBM Model 1. After we add I + 1 empty words to the target sentence, the alignment is a mapping from source to target word positions: a : j â i, i = aj where j = 1, 2, . . . , J and i = 1, 2, . . . , 2I + 1. Words from position I + 1 to 2I + 1 in the target sentence are all empty words. We allow each source word to align with exactly one target word, but each target word may align with multiple source words. The fertility Ïi of a word ei at position i is defined as the number of aligned source words: J mal alignment. We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for training and decoding, Ïi = j=1 Î´(aj , i) which has nice probabilistic guarantees. DeNero et al. (2008) applied the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to word alignment for machine translation; they do not model word fertility.
