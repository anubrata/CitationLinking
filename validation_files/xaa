The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language. We are given a source string fJ 1 = f1:::fj :::fJ of length J, which is to be translated into a target string eI 1 = e1:::ei:::eI of length I. Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability: ^eI 1 = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1jfJ 1 )g = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1) Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1)g : (1) The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language. Pr(eI 1) is the language model of the target language, whereas Pr(fJ 1 jeI1) is the transla tion model. Our approach uses word-to-word dependencies between source and target words. The model is often further restricted so that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word (Brown et al., 1993; Ney et al., 2000). These alignment models are similar to the concept of hidden Markov models (HMM) in speech recognition. The alignment mapping is j ! i = aj from source position j to target position i = aj . The use of this alignment model raises major problems if a source word has to be aligned to several target words, e.g. when translating German compound nouns. A simple extension will be used to handle this problem. In Section 2, we brie y review our approach to statistical machine translation. In Section 3, we introduce our novel concept to word reordering and a DP-based search, which is especially suitable for the translation direction from German to English. This approach is compared to another reordering scheme presented in (Berger et al., 1996). In Section 4, we present the performance measures used and give translation results on the Verbmobil task.
