There is considerable academic and commercial interest in processing subjective content in text, where subjective content refers to any expression of a private state such as an opinion or belief (Wiebe et al., 2005). Important strands of work include the identification of subjective content and the determination of its polarity, i.e. whether a favourable or unfavourable opinion is expressed. Automatic identification of subjective content often relies on word indicators, such as unigrams (Pang et al., 2002) or predetermined sentiment lexica (Wilson et al., 2005). Thus, the word positive the sentence contains a favourable opinion. However, such word-based indicators can be misleading for two reasons. First, contextual indicators such as irony and negation can reverse subjectivity or polarity indications (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2004). Second, different word senses of a single word can actually be of different subjectivity or polarity. A typical subjectivity-ambiguous word, i.e. a word that has at least one subjective and at least one objective sense, is positive, as shown by the two example senses given below.1 (1) positive, electropositiveâhaving a positive electric charge;âprotons are positiveâ (objective) (2) plus, positiveâinvolving advantage or good; âa plus (or positive) factorâ (subjective) We concentrate on this latter problem by automatically creating lists of subjective senses, instead of subjective words, via adding subjectivity labels for senses to electronic lexica, using the example of WordNet. This is important as the problem of subjectivity-ambiguity is frequent: We (Su and Markert, 2008) find that over 30% of words in our dataset are subjectivity-ambiguous. Information on subjectivity of senses can also improve other tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006). Moreover, Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) show that the performance of automatic annotation of subjectivity at the word level can be hurt by the presence of subjectivity-ambiguous words in the training sets they use. in the sentence âThis deal is a positive development for our company.â gives a strong indication that 1 All examples in this paper are from WordNet 2.0.. 1 Human Language Technologies: The 2009 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the ACL, pages 1â9, Boulder, Colorado, June 2009. Qc 2009 Association for Computational Linguistics We propose a semi-supervised approach based on minimum cut in a lexical relation graph to assign subjectivity (subjective/objective) labels to word senses.2 Our algorithm outperforms supervised minimum cuts and standard supervised, non-graph classification algorithms (like SVM), reducing the error rate by up to 40%. In addition, the semi-supervised approach achieves the same results as the supervised framework with less than 20% of the training data. Our approach also outperforms prior approaches to the subjectivity recognition of word senses and performs well across two different data sets. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses previous work. Section 3 describes our proposed semi-supervised minimum cut framework in detail. Section 4 presents the experimental results and evaluation, followed by conclusions and future work in Section 5.
