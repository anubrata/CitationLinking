In recent years, text-to-text generation has received increasing attention in the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG). In contrast to traditional concept-to-text systems, text-to-text generation systems convert source text to target text, where typically the source and target text share the same meaning to some extent. Applications of text-to-text generation include sum- marization (Knight and Marcu, 2002), question- answering (Lin and Pantel, 2001), and machine translation. For text-to-text generation it is important to know which words and phrases are semantically close or exchangable in which contexts. While there are various resources available that capture such knowledge at the word level (e.g., synset knowledge in WordNet), this kind of information is much harder to get by at the phrase level. Therefore, paraphrase acquisition can be considered an important technology for producing resources for text-to-text generation. Paraphrase generation has already proven to be valuable for Question Answering (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Riezler et al., 2007), Machine Translation (CallisonBurch et al., 2006) and the evaluation thereof (RussoLassner et al., 2006; Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006; Zhou et al., 2006), but also for text simplification and explanation. In the study described in this paper, we make an effort to collect Dutch paraphrases from news article headlines in an unsupervised way to be used in future paraphrase generation. News article headlines are abundant on the web, and are already grouped by news aggregators such as Google News. These services collect multiple articles covering the same event. Crawling such news aggregators is an effective way of collecting related articles which can straightforwardly be used for the acquisition of paraphrases (Dolan et al., 2004; Nelken and Shieber, 2006). We use this method to collect a large amount of aligned paraphrases in an automatic fashion.
