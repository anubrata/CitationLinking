Since the early days of statistical NLP, researchers have observed that a part-of-speech tag distribution exhibits âone tag per discourseâ sparsity â words are likely to select a single predominant tag in a corpus, even when several tags are possible. Simply assigning to each word its most frequent associated tag in a corpus achieves 94.6% accuracy on the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank. This distributional sparsity of syntactic tags is not unique to English 1 The source code for the work presented in this paper is available at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rbg/code/typetagging/. â similar results have been observed across multiple languages. Clearly, explicitly modeling such a powerful constraint on tagging assignment has a potential to significantly improve the accuracy of an unsupervised part-of-speech tagger learned without a tagging dictionary. In practice, this sparsity constraint is difficult to incorporate in a traditional POS induction system (MeÂ´rialdo, 1994; Johnson, 2007; Gao and Johnson, 2008; GracÂ¸a et al., 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010). These sequence models-based approaches commonly treat token-level tag assignment as the primary latent variable. By design, they readily capture regularities at the token-level. However, these approaches are ill-equipped to directly represent type-based constraints such as sparsity. Previous work has attempted to incorporate such constraints into token-level models via heavy-handed modifications to inference procedure and objective function (e.g., posterior regularization and ILP decoding) (GracÂ¸a et al., 2009; Ravi and Knight, 2009). In most cases, however, these expansions come with a steep increase in model complexity, with respect to training procedure and inference time. In this work, we take a more direct approach and treat a word type and its allowed POS tags as a primary element of the model. The model starts by generating a tag assignment for each word type in a vocabulary, assuming one tag per word. Then, token- level HMM emission parameters are drawn conditioned on these assignments such that each word is only allowed probability mass on a single assigned tag. In this way we restrict the parameterization of a Language Original case English Danish Dutch German Spanish Swedish Portuguese 94.6 96.3 96.6 95.5 95.4 93.3 95.6 Table 1: Upper bound on tagging accuracy assuming each word type is assigned to majority POS tag. Across all languages, high performance can be attained by selecting a single tag per word type. token-level HMM to reflect lexicon sparsity. This model admits a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm where the number of latent variables is proportional to the number of word types, rather than the size of a corpus as for a standard HMM sampler (Johnson, 2007). There are two key benefits of this model architecture. First, it directly encodes linguistic intuitions about POS tag assignments: the model structure reflects the one-tag-per-word property, and a type- level tag prior captures the skew on tag assignments (e.g., there are fewer unique determiners than unique nouns). Second, the reduced number of hidden variables and parameters dramatically speeds up learning and inference. We evaluate our model on seven languages exhibiting substantial syntactic variation. On several languages, we report performance exceeding that of state-of-the art systems. Our analysis identifies three key factors driving our performance gain: 1) selecting a model structure which directly encodes tag sparsity, 2) a type-level prior on tag assignments, and 3) a straightforward naÂ¨Ä±veBayes approach to incorporate features. The observed performance gains, coupled with the simplicity of model implementation, makes it a compelling alternative to existing more complex counterparts.
