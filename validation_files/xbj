Boxer is an open-domain tool for computing and reasoning with semantic representations. Based on Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), Boxer is able to construct Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs for short, informally called âboxesâ because of the way they are graphically displayed) for English sentences and texts. There is a translation from DRSs to first-order formulas, which opens the way to perform inference by including automated reasoning tools such as theorem provers and model builders (Blackburn and Bos, 2005).
