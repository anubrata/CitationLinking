Recent attention to knowledge-rich problems such as question answering [18] and textual entailment [10] has encouraged Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers to develop algorithms for automatically harvesting shallow semantic resources. With seemingly endless amounts of textual data at our disposal, we have a tremendous opportunity to automatically grow semantic term banks and ontological resources. Methods must be accurate, adaptable and scalable to the varying sizes of domain corpora (e.g., textbooks vs. World Wide Web), and independent or weakly dependent on human supervision. In this paper we present Espresso, a novel bootstrapping algorithm for automatically harvesting semantic relations, aiming at effectively supporting NLP applications, emphasizing two major points that have been partially neglected by previous systems: generality and weak supervision. From the one side, Espresso is intended as a general-purpose system able to extract a wide variety of binary semantic relations, from the classical is-a and part-of relations, to more specific and domain oriented ones like chemical reactants in a chemistry domain and position succession in political texts. The system architecture is designed with generality in mind, avoiding any relation-specific inference technique. Indeed, for each semantic relation, the system builds specific lexical patterns inferred from textual corpora. From the other side, Espresso requires only weak human supervision. In order to start the extraction process, a user provides only a small set of seed instances of a target relation (e.g. Italy-country and Canada-country for the is-a relation.) In our experience, a handful of seed instances, in general, is sufficient for large corpora while for smaller corpora, a slightly larger set is required. To guarantee weakest supervision, Espresso combines its bootstrapping approach with a web-based knowledge expansion technique and linguistic analysis, exploiting the seeds as much as possible.
