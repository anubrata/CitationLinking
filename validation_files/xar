The ability to model and automatically detect discourse structure is an important step toward understanding spontaneous dialogue. While there is hardly consensus on exactly how discourse structure should be described, some agreement exists that a useful first level of analysis involves the identification of dialogue acts (DAs). A DA represents the meaning of an utterance at the level of illocutionary force (Austin 1962). Thus, a DA is approximately the equivalent of the speech act of Searle (1969), the conversational game move of Power (1979), or the adjacency pair part of Schegloff (1968) and Saks, Schegloff, and Jefferson (1974). Table 1 shows a sample of the kind of discourse structure in which we are interested. Each utterance is assigned a unique DA label (shown in column 2), drawn from a well-defined set (shown in Table 2). Thus, DAs can be thought of as a tag set that classifies utterances according to a combination of pragmatic, semantic, and syntactic criteria. The computational community has usually defined these DA categories so as to be relevant to a particular application, although efforts are under way to develop DA labeling systems that are domain-independent, such as the Discourse Resource Initiative's DAMSL architecture (Core and Allen 1997). While not constituting dialogue understanding in any deep sense, DA tagging seems clearly useful to a range of applications. For example, a meeting summarizer needs to keep track of who said what to whom, and a conversational agent needs to know whether it was asked a question or ordered to do something. In related work DAs are used as a first processing step to infer dialogue games (Carlson 1983; Levin and Moore 1977; Levin et al. 1999), a slightly higher level unit that comprises a small number of DAs. Interactional dominance (Linell 1990) might be measured more accurately using DA distributions than with simpler techniques, and could serve as an indicator of the type or genre of discourse at hand. In all these cases, DA labels would enrich the available input for higher-level processing of the spoken words. Another important role of DA information could be feedback to lower-level processing. For example, a speech recognizer could be constrained by expectations of likely DAs in a given context, constraining the potential recognition hypotheses so as to improve accuracy.

In doing so, we will pull together previous approaches as well as new ideas. For example, our model draws on the use of DA n-grams and the hidden Markov models of conversation present in earlier work, such as Nagata and Morimoto (1993, 1994) and Woszczyna and Waibel (1994) (see Section 7). However, our framework generalizes earlier models, giving us a clean probabilistic approach for performing DA classification from unreliable words and nonlexical evidence. For the speech recognition task, our framework provides a mathematically principled way to condition the speech recognizer on conversation context through dialogue structure, as well as on nonlexical information correlated with DA identity. We will present methods in a domain-independent framework that for the most part treats DA labels as an arbitrary formal tag set. Throughout the presentation, we will highlight the simplifications and assumptions made to achieve tractable models, and point out how they might fall short of reality. Second, we present results obtained with this approach on a large, widely available corpus of spontaneous conversational speech. These results, besides validating the methods described, are of interest for several reasons. For example, unlike in most previous work on DA labeling, the corpus is not task-oriented in nature, and the amount of data used (198,000 utterances) exceeds that in previous studies by at least an order of magnitude (see Table 14). To keep the presentation interesting and concrete, we will alternate between the description of general methods and empirical results. Section 2 describes the task and our data in detail. Section 3 presents the probabilistic modeling framework; a central component of this framework, the discourse grammar, is further discussed in Section 4. In Section 5 we describe experiments for DA classification. Section 6 shows how DA models can be used to benefit speech recognition. Prior and related work is summarized in Section 7. Further issues and open problems are addressed in Section 8, followed by concluding remarks in Section 9.
