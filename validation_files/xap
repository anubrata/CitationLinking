One of the difficulties in Natural Language Processing is the fact that there are many ways to express the same thing or event. If the expression is a word or a short phrase (like âcorporationâ and âcompanyâ), it is called a âsynonymâ. There has been a lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet. If the expression is longer or complicated (like âA buys Bâ and âAâs purchase of Bâ), it is called âparaphraseâ, i.e. a set of phrases which express the same thing or event. Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications. For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question. Also, in Information Extraction (IE), in which the system tries to extract elements of some events (e.g. date and company names of a corporate merger event), several event instances from different news articles have to be aligned even if these are expressed differently. We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge. For example, we can easily imagine that the number of paraphrases for âA buys Bâ is enormous and it is not possible to create a comprehensive inventory by hand. Also, we donât know how many such paraphrase sets are necessary to cover even some everyday things or events. Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks. So, there is a limitation that IE can only be performed for a predefined task, like âcorporate mergersâ or âmanagement successionâ. In order to create an IE system for a new domain, one has to spend a long time to create the knowledge. So, it is too costly to make IE technology âopen- domainâ or âon-demandâ like IR or QA. In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus. We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications. After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue.
