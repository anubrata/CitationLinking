The difficulty of achieving adequate handÂ­ crafted semantic representations has limited the field of natural language processing to applicaÂ­ tions that can be contained within well-defined subdomains. The only escape from this limÂ­ itation will be through the use of automated or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisiÂ­ tion. However, the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computaÂ­ tional lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods, although attempts are being made (Pustejovsky, 1991), (Copestake and SanÂ­ filippo, 1993), (Lowe et al., 1997), (Dorr, 1997). The authors would like to acknowledge the supÂ­ port of DARPA grant N6600194C-6043, ARO grant DAAH0494G-0426, and CAPES grant 0914/952. One of the most controversial areas has to do with polysemy. What constitutes a clear sepaÂ­ ration into senses for any one verb, and how can these senses be computationally characterized and distinguished? The answer to this question is the key to breaking the bottleneck of semantic representation that is currently the single greatÂ­ est limitation on the general application of natÂ­ ural language processing techniques. In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases. We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, interÂ­ sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts. We also examine similar classes in Portuguese, and the predictive powers of alternations in this language with respect to the same semantic components. The difficulty of determining a suitable lexical representation becomes multiÂ­ plied when more than one language is involved and attempts are made to map between them. Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier, 1996). However, we have found interesting parÂ­ allels in how Portuguese and English treat regÂ­ ular sense extensions.
