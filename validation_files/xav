The character-based âIOBâ tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005). Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as âBâ if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or âOâ if the character functions as an independent word, or âIâ otherwise.â For example, â (whole) (Beijing city)â is labeled as â (whole)/O (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/Iâ. We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging. In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters. If only Chinese characters are used, the subword-based IOB tagging is downgraded into a character-based one. Taking the same example mentioned above, â (whole) (Beijing city)â is labeled as â (whole)/O (Beijing)/B (city)/Iâ in the subword-based tagging, where â (Beijing)/Bâ is labeled as one unit. We will give a detailed description of this approach in Section 2. â Now the second author is affiliated with NTT. In addition, we found a clear weakness with the IOB tagging approach: It yields a very low in-vocabulary (IV) rate (R-iv) in return for a higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate (R-oov). In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using conditional random fields (CRF) for the IOB tagging, yielded very high R-oovs in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower. While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired. In this work we propose a confidence measure approach to lessen the weakness. By this approach we can change R-oovs and R-ivs and find an optimal tradeoff. This approach will be described in Section 2.2. In the followings, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is implemented by the CRFs method. Section 3 presents our experimental results. Section 4 describes current state- of-the-art methods for Chinese word segmentation, with which our results were compared. Section 5 provides the concluding remarks.
