Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce, 2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001). In particular, WORDNET (Fellbaum, 1998) has significantly influenced research in NLP. Unfortunately, these resource are extremely time- consuming and labour-intensive to manually develop and maintain, requiring considerable linguistic and domain expertise. Lexicographers cannot possibly keep pace with language evolution: sense distinctions are continually made and merged, words are coined or become obsolete, and technical terms migrate into the vernacular. Technical domains, such as medicine, require separate treatment since common words often take on special meanings, and a significant proportion of their vocabulary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary. Bur- gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only a very small degree of overlap. Also, lexical- semantic resources suffer from: bias towards concepts and senses from particular topics. Some specialist topics are better covered in WORD- NET than others, e.g. dog has finer-grained distinctions than cat and worm although this does not reflect finer distinctions in reality; limited coverage of infrequent words and senses. Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every 8 sentences in the BLLIP corpus. By WORDNET 2.0, coverage has improved but the problem of keeping up with language evolution remains difficult. consistency when classifying similar words into categories. For instance, the WORDNET lexicographer file for ionosphere (location) is different to exo- sphere and stratosphere (object), two other layers of the earthâs atmosphere. These problems demonstrate the need for automatic or semiautomatic methods for the creation and maintenance of lexical-semantic resources. Broad semantic classification is currently used by lexicographers to or- ganise the manual insertion of words into WORDNET, and is an experimental precursor to automatically inserting words directly into the WORDNET hierarchy. Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNETâs hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses. This paper describes an unsupervised approach to supersense tagging that does not require annotated sentences. Instead, we use vector-space similarity to retrieve a number of synonyms for each unknown common noun. The supersenses of these synonyms are then combined to determine the supersense. This approach significantly outperforms the multi-class perceptron on the same dataset based on WORDNET 1.6 and 1.7.1. 26 Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the ACL, pages 26â33, Ann Arbor, June 2005.
