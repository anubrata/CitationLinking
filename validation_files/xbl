One of the motivations of this work is to investigate if the identification and appropriate treatment of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) in an application contributes to improve results and ultimately lead to more precise man-machine interaction. The term âmultiword expressionâ has been used to describe a large set of distinct constructions, for instance support verbs, noun compounds, institutionalized phrases and so on. Calzolari et al. (2002) defines MWEs as a sequence of words that acts as a single unit at some level of linguistic analysis. The nature of MWEs can be quite heterogeneous and each of the different classes has specific characteristics, posing a challenge to the implementation of mechanisms that provide unified treatment for them. For instance, even if a standard system capable of identifying boundaries between words, i.e. a tokenizer, may nevertheless be incapable of recognizing a sequence of words as an MWEs and treating them as a single unit if necessary (e.g. to kick the bucket meaning to die). For an NLP application to be effective, it requires mechanisms that are able to identify MWEs, handle them and make use of them in a meaningful way (Sag et al., 2002; Baldwin et al., 2003). It is estimated that the number of MWEs in the lexicon of a native speaker of a language has the same order of magnitude as the number of single words (Jackendoff, 1997). However, these ratios are probably underestimated when considering domain specific language, in which the specialized vocabulary and terminology are composed mostly by MWEs. In this paper, we perform an application-oriented evaluation of the inclusion of MWE treatment into an Information Retrieval (IR) system. IR systems aim to provide users with quick access to data they are interested (BaezaYates and RibeiroNeto, 1999). Although language processing is not vital to modern IR systems, it may be convenient (Sparck Jones, 1997) and in this scenario, NLP techniques may contribute in the selection of MWEs for indexing as single units in the IR system. The selection of appropriate indexing terms is a key factor for the quality of IR systems. In an ideal system, the index terms should correspond to the concepts found in the documents. If indexing is performed only with the atomic terms, there may be a loss of semantic content of the documents. For example, if the query was pop star meaning celebrity, and the terms were indexed individually, the relevant documents may not be retrieved and the system would 101 Proceedings of the Workshop on Multiword Expressions: from Parsing and Generation to the Real World (MWE 2011), pages 101â109, Portland, Oregon, USA, 23 June 2011.

In order to investigate the effects of indexing of MWEs for IR, the results of queries are analyzed using IR quality metrics. This paper is structured as follows: in section 2 we discuss briefly MWEs and some of the challenges they represent. This is followed in section 3 by a discussion of the materials and methods employed in this paper, and in section 4 of the evaluation performed. We finish with some conclusions and future work.
